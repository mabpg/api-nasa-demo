### Change DEMO_KEY with your own API key (https://api.nasa.gov/)

DEMO_KEY Rate Limits<br>
In documentation examples, the special DEMO_KEY api key is used. This API key can be used for initially exploring APIs prior to signing up, but it has much lower rate limits, so youâ€™re encouraged to signup for your own API key if you plan to use the API (signup is quick and easy). The rate limits for the DEMO_KEY are:<br>

Hourly Limit: 30 requests per IP address per hour<br>
Daily Limit: 50 requests per IP address per day
